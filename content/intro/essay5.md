### About Tattersall Distilling ###

[Tattersall Distilling](https://tattersalldistilling.com/) is an award-winning distillery and cocktail room based in Northeast Minneapolis in the Historic Thorp Building---a warehouse that was once a top-secret manufacturing location for the Norden bombsight in World War II. Its extensive portfolio of over 30 all-natural spirits and liqueurs are always made from the best ingredients available. The cocktail room serves cocktails made exclusively with Tattersall spirits and fresh, house-made bitters, syrups, tonics, tinctures, and shrubs. As a result, Tattersall has earned national and international recognition with top honors from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, American Craft Spirits Association, and American Distilling Institute for its spirits. From sourcing ingredients locally to implementing a comprehensive organics program, Tattersall is dedicated to cutting its carbon footprint. The distillery sources the majority of its grains from a sixth generation farmer just 50 miles north of its front door. Plus, spent grains are used as hog and cattle feed at a farm in the same town. Tattersall is proud to partner with Hennepin County and the City of Minneapolis to continue to reduce its waste with a comprehensive organics program throughout the distillery and cocktail room. You can find Tattersall products at bars, restaurants, and liquor stores in 23 states across the country.
