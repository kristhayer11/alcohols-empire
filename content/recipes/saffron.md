[Bitters](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/what-are-bitters-and-how-to-use-them-cocktails-article) are made by infusing bitter botanicals in a high-proof base alcohol.[^2] Today they are a key flavoring component in cocktails; however, they first came into widespread use as medicinal aids. According to alcohol historian David Wondrich, when hungover Europeans started adding bitters to their wine and brandy as a restorative "hair of the dog" in the 1700s, they planted the seeds for the cocktails we enjoy today.[^3]

True to form, this 1820 bitters recipe packs a medicinal punch. Notably, it features gentian root, an herb used for millennia to treat a variety of ailments that is proven to calm the stomach and help digestion (when consumed in moderation, so drink responsibly!). Gentian remains a key ingredient in [Angostura bitters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/one-weird-cocktail-has-spread-to-menus-worldwide-because-it-works/2015/09/27/7cdb0f6c-62e7-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.501537cc7e98).

<br>
Saffron---made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower, a plant with origins in the Middle East---has also long been used to treat a range of ailments. An important source for yellow dye, saffron's major contribution to this Wine Bitters is a pleasing, golden undertone. The dominant vibrant red color comes thanks to cochineal, a red dye formulated by the Aztecs and Maya of Central America from pulverized cochineal insects around 4,000 years ago. Today, cochineal is still [widely used](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43786055) as a food and drink colorant, and it remains an important export for Peru; it is not, however, vegetarian.[^5] In 2006 [Campari](https://daily.sevenfifty.com/bug-based-coloring-makes-a-comeback-in-spirits/) opted for artificial color in its iconic red bitters.[^6]



<br>
For a low alcohol option, add this saffron bitters to tonic water---a quinine-infused refreshment once favored by Brits in colonial India for its antimalarial properties. Until synthetic quinine was developed in 1944, the natural version was derived from Peruvian [cinchona bark](https://www.lib.umn.edu/bell/tradeproducts/cinchonabark); Europeans started importing cinchona bark for antimalarial medicines in the 1630s, after which it quickly took off.[^8] The Wangensteen Historical Library has an early manuscript example of an English recipe that uses cinchona against malaria: in 1659, Chris Dodssonn wrote in his copy of Nicholas Culpepers' translation of the *Pharmacopoeia Londinensis,* "For your ague: Take 2 drams of Quin Quina or Jesuit's Bark, beat it to a powder & infuse it in a draught of Clarit or white wine 2 hours & take it when your fitt begins & cetera."[^9]

Added to the mix is some [mint syrup](/appendix) with origins in a Spanish-Morrocan medicinal recipe from the 1200s. Mint has been used for centuries (and still is!) to ease digestion.
