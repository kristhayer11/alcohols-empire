### ‘It’s a Deal’—but Hold the Arsenic ###
Ratafia---or ratifia, as it was also spelled---was a sweet cordial, made by steeping almonds or fruit stones in brandy. The name appears in English texts in the 1600s, but it may have originated in the French Caribbean, where a similar word for rum was common: tafia. Some speculate that tafia and ratafia were corruptions of the Latin "rata fiat" or "rata fiat conventio"---meaning "let the agreement be ratified." Perhaps the custom of concluding business with a glass of rum or ratafia, leading to the toast "it's a deal," refers to those drinks.

The illustration below, dating from 1758 and held in the WHL collections, identifies various types of pear and their harvest seasons.  [^1] Use the tool to zoom.

By the 1820s, French brandy, which had long been prestigious, had dominated the global market in distilled alcohol for a couple of centuries. Around this time French brandy makers had also upped their game in long barrel-aging, making the "best French brandy" even better.

In our contemporary variation on an 1820s English recipe for ratifia, pear stands in for quince. Our mixologist has swapped bitter almonds---which contain traces of arsenic---with sour cherry stones. Ratafia can be served warm or cold.
